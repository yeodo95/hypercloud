For example, the credentials returned by the broker may include the key "USERNAME", but the consumer requires the username to be exposed under the key "DB_USER" instead. To have the Service Catalog transform the Secret, the following SecretTransform must be specified in ServiceBinding.spec.secretTransform: - {"renameKey": {"from": "USERNAME", "to": "DB_USER"}} Only one of the SecretTransform''s members may be specified.'
